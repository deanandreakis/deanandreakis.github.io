[REPORT: APPLE’S IOS AND MACOS LOSE MARKET SHARE TO CHROME OS IN US K-12](https://9to5mac.com/2017/03/02/apple-ios-market-share-k-12-education-chrome-os/)

Jordan Kahn, reporting for 9to5Mac:

>Apple’s iOS and macOS platforms both lost share to Chrome OS in the US K-12 education market last year, according to new data from Futuresource Consulting (via The New York Times). In the US, Chrome OS managed to grow to 58% market share in 2016 up from 50% a year earlier, while iOS dropped to 14%, down from 19% in 2015, and macOS dropped to 5% share, down from 6%.

Not surprising. Chrome OS is a natural fit in the K-12 market where price means everything. Chrome OS also provides low maintenance overhead since data is created and saved in the cloud which is a big advantage for schools with tiny IT budgets.
