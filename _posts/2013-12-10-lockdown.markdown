Not much is as terrifying as receiving a text from your spouse that the school that she and two of your children are in is in lockdown due to a gunman spotted in the area. Unfortunately this is how I started my day today. I raced to the scene and kept her informed as to what was going on outside. Turns out there was a man hold-up in a home near the school threatening suicide. Police were eventually able to place the man under arrest. Here is a link to the <a href="http://my.chicagotribune.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-78497953/">story</a>. Everyone came home frazzled from the experience. Appreciate every moment you have with your family. Hold your family close peopleâ€¦
