Amazon introduces there Prime Air delivery service. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ref_=tsm_1_tw_s_amzn_mx3eqp&amp;node=8037720011">Amazon Prime Air</a>. The concept of a drone flying to my home within thirty minutes of a placed order to deliver the order seems futuristic to say the least. Seems FAA regulations will keep this one a few years away. I don't really think I would want some flying drone with spinning blades landing in my driveway...seems creepy and unsafe.
