Yesterday Apple released there [fiscal 2015 first quarter financial results](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/01/27Apple-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Results.html). They reported 74.6 billion dollars (US) in revenue and 18 billion dollars (US) in profits. These numbers are huge. They represent [the most profitable quarter by any company ever](http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/27/apple-just-had-the-biggest-quarterly-earnings-of-any-company-ever/). The term "printing money" came to mind instantly, so I decided to actually compare them to how much paper currency the U.S. Treasury prints in the same timeframe. It turns out that the [U.S. Treasury prints about 696 million dollars (face value) per day](http://aboutusa.japan.usembassy.gov/e/jusa-faq-money.html#147). This calculates to about 63 billion dollars in a quarter which is 11.6 billion dollars less then what Apple had in revenue during a similar time period. So basically the U.S. Treasury doesn't print as much money as Apple had in revenue during the last quarter. Astounding.
