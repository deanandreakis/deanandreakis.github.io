There are few words to describe exactly how blessed I am. My wife and children are happy and healthy and amazing in there own special ways. It's Friday evening and my family and I just returned from visiting my mother and sisters in southern Indiana. We ate way too much and caught up on each other's lives. Each visit with my eighty-six year old mother is a blessing. Tomorrow we spend the day at my in-laws for thanksgiving meal number two. Even though it is cliche I will say it anyway: Family is the most important thing! Thank you Lord! Happy Thanksgiving to all...
