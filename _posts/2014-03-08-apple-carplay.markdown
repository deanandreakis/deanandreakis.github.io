Apple last weeked announced there automotive integration called [CarPlay](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/). It will be available in Ferrri, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo models this year, with many additional car companies signing up for the future. I think this will be a good integration that allows for handsfree messaging, music controls, calls, and maps. A significant challenge will be that Siri voice control is at the center of this technology and has had a mediocre history at best. Siri has had a spotty history at best since its introduction in 2011 with the iPhone 4S. An early [test](http://gizmodo.com/5922332/google-search-beats-the-crap-out-of-siri-in-1600-question-test) of the voice assistant conducted by Gizmodo showed that it recognized and answered only 68% of questions correctly. In my opinion Apple really needs to improve Siri significantly or else risk poor acceptance of there new CarPlay product.
