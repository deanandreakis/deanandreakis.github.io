Apple announced there new mobile payment system called [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/apple-pay/) as part of the release of iOS 8. It's based on [NFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication) technology and promises to be a much more secure way for end users to complete there payment transactions. The added security means that the end users name and credit card number are not revealed to the retailer, just a temporary number used only for that transaction. In contrast, when a user currently swipes there credit or debit card there name and card number are revealed to the retailer and are often used for further targeted marketing to the user. Apple pay is currently only available to iPhone 6/6+ owners since it requires an NFC chip in the device. My opinion is that Apple Pay will ultimately succeed in the marketplace since it rides on top of the current credit card transaction system and the end user experience is very convenient. The end user experience just requires a user who has already setup there iPhone 6/6+ device with at least one credit card in the Passbook app to present there iPhone in front of an NFC terminal at checkout and then use there [Apple touch ID](https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/touch-id/) to verify the transaction. In some cases the store may opt to have the user physically sign a receipt but this is not a requirement of the system.
