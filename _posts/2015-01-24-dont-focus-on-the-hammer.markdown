I am a technologist. I love to learn new software languages and techniques as much as time and effort permit. My focus is on mobile development and specifically the Apple iOS platform. I listen to technical podcasts, read way too many technical blogs, and watch technical screencasts. All this tends to sate my thirst for knowledge but also makes me somewhat too focused on the tools. It's as if I am in love with the hammer without seeing that I am building a house! I feel as though I, and many software developers in my field, are enamored with the tools we have but often lose sight of what it is we want to do with them. One of my goals for this year is to change my perspective. I want to define what it is I want to build and accomplish and who it is I want to help before I get too focused on the tools and technologies I will use to achieve my goals. The article I recently read by [Andreesen-Horowitz](http://a16z.com/2015/01/22/16-things/) spurred my thinking about this by giving a broad overview of areas that are ripe for technology to revolutionize.
