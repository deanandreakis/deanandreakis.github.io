When I was 17 in 1983, I finally got my drivers license. I was absolutely thrilled and couldn't wait to drive to my friends houses and finally cross that great American threshold of independence. I was lucky enough to also get my own car at the same time. It was a 1974 blue Ford Torino. I drove that car for the next two years and loved every second of it. It eventually caught fire while I was driving it and while my father was in the passenger seat, but that's a story for another time (btw nobody was injured but it marked the end of life for the car). Getting a drivers license and car has marked the independence of teenagers in America for many decades. I believe that in the digital era an additional mark of independence is the smartphone. When a young teen or child gets there own smartphone they gain there digital independence. Two of my children have smartphones and they regularly text, Facebook, tweet, snapchat, and Instagram with there social peers. They trade photos and videos, take selfies, and play multiplayer games. They have taken there place in the digital society. They came of age in an era when there online persona was often more important then there real persona. This is not a commentary on whether all this online presence has any lasting value, just observations from a father with three kids and more iDevices then can be counted.
