[WITH APPLE MUSIC AT 20M USERS, SPOTIFY HITS 50M PAYING SUBSCRIBER MILESTONE](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/02/spotify-hits-50m-user-milestone/)

Juli Clover, reporting for MacRumors:

>Spotify is Apple Music's staunchest rival and over the course of the last year, the two music services have clashed several times due to Apple Music's tactic using exclusives to lure new customers. Spotify in August made headlines when it allegedly started punishing artists who agreed to Apple Music exclusives, displaying their content less prominently and offering fewer promotional opportunities. Spotify denied the claims, but the relationship between the two has grown increasingly heated as Apple Music's popularity grows. Both services are now testing new features and subscription models to attract new users. 

Rivalry between big competitors is usually good for consumers. I am looking forward to the competition.
