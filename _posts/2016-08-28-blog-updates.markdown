I have hosted this blog on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for a couple years now and until recently was happy to use the feature-rich [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) blogging framework. Octopress provides a fairly rich set of plugins and configurations on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that provide a technical blogger all the tools necessary to create and manage a professional looking blog. The issue I had with Octopress is that by its own admission the "plugins and configurations were hard to disentangle". This made it rather difficult for a blogging newbie such as myself to easily change the functionality, look and feel of the site over time. I found myself spending way more time trying to properly configure the site then actually writing posts. It is for these reasons that I decided to overhaul my blog and evaluate other choices for the blogging framework. I ultimately decided to go with Jekyll plus a simple Jekyll theme. Octopress is in fact built on top of Jekyll so most of the configuration was familiar. I continue to host the site on GitHub pages as it is fast, free and pretty reliable. The Jekyll theme I selected is called [dbyll](https://github.com/dbtek/dbyll) and I like its minimalistic approach.
