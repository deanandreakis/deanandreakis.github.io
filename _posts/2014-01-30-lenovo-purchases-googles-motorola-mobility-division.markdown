As reported by Ina Fried over at re/code, <a href="http://recode.net/2014/01/29/its-official-lenovo-is-buying-motorola-from-google-for-2-91-billion/">Lenovo is purchasing the Motorola Mobility</a> division of Google for a reported 2.91 billion. Motorola Mobility was purchased a couple years back by Google for 12.5 billion and at the time the speculation was that Google primarily wanted the deep Motorola patent portfolio to help it defend it's Android platform. Google is keeping rights to most of the Motorola patent portfolio in this deal which seems to somewhat validate Google's primary interest in the patents and not the Motorola engineering. Motorola has done nothing but bleed money for Google and given that Google paid almost 10 billion more for Motorola then they were able to sell it to Lenovo for and the fact that the Motorola patents have not been very effective for Google, I don't see any other way to characterize this than a total waste of time and money for Google.
