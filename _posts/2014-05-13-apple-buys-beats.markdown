Apple today announced they are purchasing Beats Music and Beats Electronics, the makers of the popular beats by dr. dre headphones and accessories, for a reported 3 billion dollars (US). The main question many are asking is why Apple would purchase Beats. We need to look at what Beats has that Apple does not to attempt an answer. 

>In just five years since launch, the Beats “b” has become the brand of choice in the music and sports worlds, and is the market leader in the premium headphone market. Music superstars including Lady Gaga, Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj have designed their own customized Beats headphones and speakers. Fashion designers and street artists such as Alexander Wang, Futura and Snarkitecture have collaborated on special limited products, while renowned athletes including LeBron James, Serena Williams and Neymar use Beats as a critical part of their training and game day process. Beats has quickly become part of pop culture in the US and with the acquisition the Beats product lineup will be offered in many more countries through the Apple Online Store, Apple’s retail stores and select Apple Authorized Resellers.

First, Beats has taken headphones and made them into a fashion item and thus an item people are willing to pay much more for then there audio quality may demand. Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre are the founders of Beats and they quickly made a strong fashion brand by designing the headphones to look good and by also making sure that key sports and entertainment celebrities wore Beats headphones in order to gain the "it" or "cool" factor. The key factor that Beats understood well is that the average person will not be able to discern and thus pay for much difference in audio quality but they absolutely will pay for a fashion brand that looks good and is popular.

>Iovine has been at the forefront of innovation in the music industry for decades, and he has been an instrumental partner for Apple and iTunes® for more than a decade. He has produced or collaborated with some of the most successful artists in the history of the iTunes Store®, helping make it the world’s number one music retailer. Iovine and Dr. Dre are sound pioneers, artists and entrepreneurs.

The second main thing Apple gets with this purchase is the industry connections that Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine have. Jimmy Iovine is the co-founder of Interscope Records and chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M. Dr. Dre is a record producer, rapper and entrepreneur. He is the founder and CEO of Aftermath Entertainment as well as the co-owner of Death Row Records. Apple is probably betting that Jimmy and Dr. Dre will be able to help Apple negotiate content deals on an ongoing basis given there music industry insider status. Apple is heavily invested in the music industry but because of there dominant position with iTunes many content providers have locked Apple out of the music streaming business. Beats has existing streaming deals that Apple may be able to leverage.

I believe that the Beats brand will be kept by Apple after the acquisition even though this is unusual for Apple to do. Beats is too strong a brand in this category to simply subsume it into Apple.
